# 7i76e

The 7i76e Configuration Tool will create a complete configuration from scratch.

Read in the ini configuration file for changes.

You can create a configuration then run it with the Axis GUI and use
Machine > Calibration to tune each axis. Save the values to the ini file and
next time you run the 7i76e Configuration Tool it will read the values from the
ini file.
